<h3><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h3>


<p>My office on this occasion is one which I may well carry as lightly as
possible. In our society, I am told, one needs an introduction to a
beautiful woman; but I have never heard of men needing an introduction
to a beautiful song. Prose before poetry is an unmeaning interruption;
for poetry is perhaps the one thing in the world that explains itself.
The only possible prelude for songs is silence; and I shall endeavour
here to imitate the brevity of the silence as well as its stillness.</p>

<p>This collection contains four new poems by one whom all serious critics
now class with Shelley and Keats and those other great ones cut down
with their work unfinished. Yet I would not speak specially of him, lest
modern critics should run away with their mad notion of a one-man
influence; and call this a "school" of Francis Thompson. Francis
Thompson was not a schoolmaster. He would have said as freely as Whitman
(and with a far more consistent philosophy), "I charge you to leave all
free, as I have left all free." The modern world has this mania about
plagiarism because the modern world cannot comprehend the idea of
communion. It thinks that men must steal ideas; it does not understand
that men may share them. The saints did not imitate each other; not
always even study each other; they studied the Imitation of Christ. A
real religion is that in which any two solitary people might suddenly
say the same thing at any moment. It would therefore be most misleading
to give to this collection an air of having been inspired by its most
famous contributor. The little lyrics of this little book must surely be
counted individual, even by those who may count them mysterious. A
variety verging on quaintness is the very note of the assembled bards.</p>

<p>Take, for example, Mr. Colum's stern and simple rendering of the bitter
old Irish verses:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"O woman, shapely as the swan,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">On your account I shall not die."</span><br />
</p>

<p>Like Fitzgerald's Omar and all good translations, it leaves one
wondering whether the original was as good; but to an Englishman the
note is not only unique, but almost hostile. It is the hardness of the
real Irishman which has been so skilfully hidden under the softness of
the stage Irishman. The words are ages old, I believe; they come out of
the ancient Ireland of Cairns and fallen Kings: and yet the words might
have been spoken by one of Bernard Shaw's modern heroes to one of his
modern heroines. The curt, bleak words, the haughty, heathen spirit are
certainly as remote as anything can be from the luxuriant humility of
Francis Thompson.</p>

<p>If the writers have a real point of union it is in a certain instinct
for contrast between their shape and subject matter. All the poems are
brief in form, and at the same time big in topic. They remind us of the
vivid illuminations of the virile thirteenth century, when artists
crowded cosmic catastrophes into the corner of an initial letter; where
one may find a small picture of the Deluge or of the flaming Cities of
the Plain. One of the specially short poems sees the universe overthrown
and the good angels conquered. Another short poem sees the newsboys in
Fleet Street shouting the news of the end of the world, and the awful
return of God. The writers seem unconsciously to have sought to make a
poem as large as a revelation, while it was nearly as short as a riddle.
And though Francis Thompson himself was rather in the Elizabethan
tradition of amplitude and ingenuity, he could write separate lines that
were separate poems in themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"And thou, what needest with thy tribe's black tents,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Who hast the red pavilion of my heart?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>A mediaeval illuminator would have jumped out of his sandals in his
eagerness to illustrate that.</p>

"Why do you talk of never enjoying moments like

Ariel to Miranda:&mdash;hear<br />
This good-night the sea-winds bear;<br />
And let thine unacquainted ear<br />
Take grief for their interpreter.<br />
<br />
Good-night; I have risen so high<br />
Into slumber's rarity,<br />
Not a dream can beat its feather<br />
Through the unsustaining ether.<br />
Let the sea-winds make avouch<br />
How thunder summoned me to couch,<br />
Tempest curtained me about<br />
And turned the sun with his own hand out:<br />
And though I toss upon my bed<br />
My dream is not disquieted;<br />
Nay, deep I sleep upon the deep,<br />
And my eyes are wet, but I do not weep;<br />
And I fell to sleep so suddenly<br />
That my lips are moist yet&mdash;could'st thou see<br />
With the good-night draught I have drunk to thee.<br />
Thou can'st not wipe them; for it was Death<br />
Damped my lips that has dried my breath.<br />
A little while&mdash;it is not long&mdash;<br />
The salt shall dry on them like the song.<br />
<br />
Now know'st thou, that voice desolate,<br />
Mourning ruined joy's estate,<br />
Reached thee through a closing gate.<br />
"Go'st thou to Plato?" Ah, girl, no!<br />
It is to Pluto that I go.<br />

<p class="verse">
O Lady Mary, thy bright crown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is no mere crown of majesty;</span><br />
For with the reflex of His own<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Resplendent thorns Christ circled thee.</span><br />
<br />
The red rose of this passion tide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Doth take a deeper hue from thee,</span><br />
In the five Wounds of Jesus dyed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in Thy bleeding thoughts, Mary.</span><br />
<br />
The soldier struck a triple stroke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That smote thy Jesus on the tree;</span><br />
He broke the Heart of hearts, and broke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Saint's and Mother's hearts in thee.</span><br />
<br />
Thy Son went up the Angels' ways,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His passion ended; but, ah me!</span><br />
Thou found'st the road of further days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A longer way of Calvary.</span><br />
<br />
On the hard cross of hopes deferred<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou hung'st in loving agony,</span><br />
Until the mortal dreaded word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which chills our mirth, spake mirth to thee.</span><br />
<br />
The Angel Death from this cold tomb<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of life did roll the stone away;</span><br />
And He thou barest in thy womb<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Caught thee at last into the day&mdash;</span><br />
Before the living throne of Whom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lights of heaven burning pray.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">L'ENVOY.</span><br />
<br />
O thou who dwellest in the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behold, I pace amidst the gloom:</span><br />
Darkness is ever round my way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With little space for sunbeam room.</span><br />
<br />
Yet Christian sadness is divine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Even as thy patient sadness was:</span><br />
The salt tears in our life's dark wine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fell in it from the saving Cross.</span><br />
<br />
Bitter the bread of our repast;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet doth a sweet the bitter leaven:</span><br />
Our sorrow is the shadow cast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Around it by the light of Heaven.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O Light in light, shine down from Heaven!</span><br />

Saadi the Poet stood up and he put forth his<br />

His songs were the hurtling of spears and<br />

<br />
Umimah my loved one was by me: without<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">love did these eyes see my fawn,</span><br />
And if fire there were in her being, for me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">its splendour had gone;</span><br />
When the sun storms up on the tent, he makes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">waste the fire of the grass&mdash;</span><br />
It was thus with my loved one's beauty: the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">splendour of song made it pass.</span><br />
<br />
The desert, the march, and the onset&mdash;these<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">and these only avail,</span><br />
Hands hard with the handling of spear-shafts,<br />

And as for the kisses of women&mdash;these are<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">honey, the poet sings;</span><br />

Night. O Thou God! who rulest Heaven and earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The terraced atmospheres, the bounded seas;</span><br />
Who knowest equally both death and birth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Frail human men, strong divine mysteries,</span><br />
Whose unencumbered thought sways all the spheres,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all their turning, snake-like, perfect ways;</span><br />
Now that the season of my labour nears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grant me an insight to Thy larger days!</span><br />
<br />
To Thee all things create and unborn yield,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Being of Thee, the secret of their souls&mdash;</span><br />
The traversed elements, the azure field<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereo'er eternal each huge star-world rolls.</span><br />
There is no tiny insect but does know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Itself within Thy Presence visual:</span><br />
From us too swiftly years and seasons go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Thee all change is a thing gradual.</span><br />
<br />
E'en as at nightfall, when the lights come in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The moth attracted woos and meets her death,</span><br />
So do I seek Thy light to wander in,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though fearfully and with half-bated breath.</span><br />
So do I seek all knowledge of Thy stars,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which move in and without my vision's reach;</span><br />
Maybe yet burning with internal wars,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or shaking as this world with human speech.</span><br />
<br />
Stars which perhaps ten thousand years ago<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Waned and grew cold at Thy almighty word</span><br />
Waft their light hitherward. I do not know&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy recreating voice I have not heard.</span><br />
Maybe, e'en at this hour Thine accents shake<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some chaos into order, into life;</span><br />
Perchance some great creation now doth break<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into new form beneath Thy wisdom's knife.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, Lord! The night appals me. Give me strength<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within myself to search this planet's dome:</span><br />
O Supreme Architect, give me at length<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some clearer knowledge of Thy spaceless home!</span><br />

Oh, Love, what fate is ours? No summer morning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall give us joy, no sunrise bring relief;</span><br />
No end&mdash;no end is there unto our sorrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No measure to our grief.</span><br />
<br />
You looked at me, and all your living beauty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swept to my heart in flame a moment's space,</span><br />
A sudden mist of tears in darkness veiling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The glory of your face.</span><br />
<br />
You spoke: I seemed to hear the wild doves cooing&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rain upon the hills, sweet falling rain;</span><br />
And all my soul was filled with joy and anguish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In ecstasy of pain.</span><br />
<br />
I saw as in a mist celestial visions<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond the bitter seas whence hope has fled,</span><br />
Heard the wind blow among the trees in summer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But knew not what you said.</span><br />
<br />
It matters not what words the lips have spoken<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When heart shall speak to heart, for love can hear</span><br />
Unspoken words, and see as in reflection<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His own thoughts mirrored there.</span><br />
<br />
You came to me, the sun arose in splendour;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I saw the roses spread their petals sweet,</span><br />
And thought that all the world must see in wonder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wings upon our feet.</span><br />
<br />
You touched me, and a wave of passionate longing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flooded my soul until it swooned away,</span><br />
And knew no more the sunlight from the shadow&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If it were night or day.</span><br />
<br />
We wandered in the shadow of the woodland,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mute while we looked into each other's eyes,</span><br />
And saw as in still pools of darkened water<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wonder of the skies.</span><br />
<br />
No word we spoke. We knew that love had silenced<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All that we wished to speak yet left unsaid;</span><br />
The bees were humming in the wild-rose blossoms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which clustered overhead.</span><br />
<br />
And all that summer day we were together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alone with love, yet with a sword between&mdash;</span><br />
The flaming sword that stands between us ever,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all that might have been.</span><br />
<br />
Mist gathered white at evening in the valleys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And slowly grew the dusk from gold to grey,</span><br />
While rain-clouds gathered on the low horizon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dark at the close of day.</span><br />
<br />
And softly rose a wind from out the darkness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With scent of flower and fern and herb and tree,</span><br />
And in its breath there came a sound of thunder,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Storm-laden from the sea.</span><br />
<br />
And thus we reached the wicket of the garden;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wood was full of sound, the sound of wings;</span><br />
The scent of lavender brought back remembrance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of long-forgotten things.</span><br />
<br />
Though heaven and earth and sky should be forgotten,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet of that hour my soul should bear the trace:</span><br />
For night fell fast, and in the deepening shadow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You turned and kissed my face.</span><br />

O self unskilled in self! O taught of my one kiss!<br />

<p class="verse">
A maiden's love most nuptial is,<br />
Innocent of his nuptial kiss;<br />
And only after marriage call<br />
Her lips, her passion, virginal!<br />
<br />
For when she dreams, who is beloved,<br />
The ancient miracle stands proved&mdash;<br />
Virginity's much Motherhood!<br />
For O, the unborn babes she keeps,<br />
The unthought glory, lips unwooed!&mdash;<br />
And O, the quickening of her sleeps<br />
Whose dreams, dreamed over, do repeat<br />
The echoes of Love's falling feet!<br />
For his, her young inviolate mouth<br />
Longs with the longing of long drouth:<br />
And, lacking substance for such feast,<br />
She clasps a dream-baby to breast,<br />
And kisses, where her head has place,<br />
The dream-lips of her love's dream-face!<br />
<br />
On the decked bridal bed of Night<br />
She knows the Moon shows maiden light&mdash;<br />
The Sun's kiss urged in marriage-rite!<br />
So, when her very night shall come,<br />
Virginal, in her virgin home<br />
When stars show unfamiliar faces,<br />
Laughing for love in their high places&mdash;<br />
When her essential lips are dumb<br />
In a thronged panic of embraces&mdash;<br />
Her maiden heart, her spousal breast,<br />
Shall throb, surrendered and possessed,<br />
Throb, passion-sweet and ungainsaid&mdash;<br />
"Now at the last am I a Maid!"<br />

<p class="verse">
I do confess I have no art<br />
To tell the tale of my own heart.<br />
<br />
Of lips and tears, of hearts and eyes,<br />
I rhyme my rhymes and fear my fears;<br />
And if of these I make you wise,<br />
These pictured hearts, these lips, these tears,<br />
There is nought to do; I have played my part.<br />
<br />
And I, a captain of much guile,<br />
Within your ranks dissensions preach<br />
Till all are jealous, each of each&mdash;<br />
Your eyes, lips, heart, a tear, a smile!<br />
<br />
So, when you turn your eyes away<br />
From mirrored eyes, and when you stay<br />
Love-hearing with reluctant hand,<br />
Straight then your heart-throbs will betray<br />
That you have read, and understand!<br />
<br />
And should your maiden heart uprise<br />
Against fain ears and full-fain eyes,<br />
Upon your lips, that cannot err,<br />
I set my kiss-interpreter!<br />
<br />
Or hold you steadfast as allies<br />
Your heart, hand, lips, your smiles, your all,<br />
Your faithful eyes are traitrous eyes&mdash;<br />
Out-steals a tear to your downfall!<br />
<br />
Your heart, your eyes, the lips of you<br />

Make all my song; have I sung true?<br />
Make all my song; are you song-wise?<br />

Sorrow, and superfluity.<br />

For your mute voice more mute I made,<br />
And at your singing proffered song;<br />
You trembled, and I was afraid&mdash;<br />
Were pierced, I fell on the same blade&mdash;<br />
Triumphed, and then my arm was strong.<br />
For peace I builded on your peace,<br />
And on your weakness mine up-piled;<br />
Of too fond hope I made increase,<br />
And at your smilings, as a child,<br />
Ignorant of their cost, I smiled.<br />

Always I fear at sight of fears,<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
